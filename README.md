# Regular Expression Reference Notebook

I put together this Regex summary notebook to help revise regular expression, and to return too when I get stuck. It covers regular expression in general, and then using the re module in Python.

Was created using the fantastic youtube tutorials by Corey Schafer, https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5
